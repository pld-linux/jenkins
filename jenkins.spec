%description
Hudson monitors executions of repeated jobs, such as building a
software project or jobs run by cron.

Among those things, current Hudson focuses on the following two jobs:
- Building/testing software projects continuously, just like
  CruiseControl or DamageControl. In a nutshell, Hudson provides an
  easy-to-use so-called continuous integration system, making it easier
  for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it
  easier for users to obtain a fresh build. The automated, continoues
  build increases the productivity.
- Monitoring executions of externally-run jobs, such as cron jobs and
  procmail jobs, even those that are run on a remote machine. For
  example, with cron, all you receive is regular e-mails that capture
  the output, and it is up to you to look at them diligently and notice
  when it broke. Hudson keeps those outputs and makes it easy for you to
  notice when something is wrong.
